The lab 3 assignment is to be completed by April 3rd, 11:59 pm.
Later submission means you won't receive full grade 
(only 75%, given everything you submit is correct)

There are 3 programs that you should write. 
Each program implements scheduling algorithm:
	First Come - First Serve
	Shortest Job Next
	Priority

Below is the same as in lab 2:

Please comment you code, so that I can understand 
your particular choice of actions in solutions. 
Try to especially comment what each variable in 
the code means in the comments.

Based on the results, write a small report 
explaining which algorithm works 
best for the input data in the test file.

To summarize, you should submit: 
	3 source code files (preferably)
	one small report (either pdf or docx) which contains:
		the results for each algorithm (order of jobs, turnaround time, 
		etc., see text files for each problem)
		the explanation for which algorithm works best for the input and why.

Good luck!
