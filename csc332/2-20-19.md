## Mem. paging
Program not in contiguous mem.

CPU finds in mem as:
```
[ page num | displacement ]
```
OS will create a page table.

Page num. will point to frame no. in page table.

## creating page table
Each page will be about 4k.

There will be special registers with tables.

Page table will contain frame number.

This is to counter external fragmentation.

BUT there is *internal fragmentation*; the page may be larger than the last section of code.
- internal frag. is consequence of fixed part. sizes.

Pages can then be made smaller, BUT then the table will be large.

*Registers* are used for speed; if mem. was used, there would be 2 checks of mem. by cpu.
- a cache is used (heap), using high-speed elements.

## Cache
hit ratio  = hits/hits+misses
- 80 - 98% efficiency of cpu finding what it is looking for in cache.

Typically a page is 4k.
- Sparc has 8k.
- x86 cpu has 8g page.

### Example

Job (pages)
```
p0
p1
p2
p3

```

Page table
```
page no. | frame no.
--------------------
0			1
1			4
2			3
3			7
```

Frames (phy. mem.)
```
0
1	p0
2
3	p2
4
5
6
```
We don't want to give all frames to a single program.

If there are no pages for mem., there will be a waiting time.
- We don't have to load entire program in mem. now.
- OS does NOT know which page to load first.

### Demand paging
- If there is no space for a page, an existing page must be replaced with new page.
- A page replacement algorithm will be used.
