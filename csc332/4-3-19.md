## Parallel Processor Architecture

## Bus
- Connects multiple devices

## Symmetric Multiprocessors
- Multiple processors share single OS.
- Processors also share I/O bus and memory
- Design:
	- cpu1: Master (runs OS)
	- cpu2: Slave (runs user process)
	- cpuN: Slave ...
	- ...
	- Memory: user processes
	- I/O
