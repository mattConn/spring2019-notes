## Review

### Demand paging
- If there is a free frame, page is loaded to this frame
- If no free frame, old frame must be chosen to be replaced

Page replacement algorithms locate frame needed to be freed:
- first in, first out
- page has address number

#### Thrashing
- When virtual memory is overused leading to a constant state of paging and page faults.

#### Segmentation

#### Process Scheduling
- Round robin

#### Deadlocks
- See presentation on BB (bankers avoidance algorithm)
	- know how to implement
