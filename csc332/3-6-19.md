## Process States

- start
- ready
	- waiting
- running
- terminated

## Process control block (PCB)
A table that reads as follows:
- Process ID
	- pointer to the process
----
- Process state
----
- Process state info:
	- program counter
	- registers
	- mem. current address
	- page table
	- resources
	- priority

A process is executing, then there may be an OS interrupt.

State info will be saved in PCB.
.
.
.
Reload state from PCB

Interrupt or syscall

## process scheduling
### Batch 
- FCFS (first come first serve)
- SJN (Shortest job next)
	- length of job is considered
- Shortest Remaining Time

### Interactive (Jobs that may include io)
- priorities
- round robin

### real time (deadline scheduling alogrithms)

 . . .

Process manager has control over only how much time is spent in the waiting queue by a process. Each method aims to reduce the amount of time a process spends in a queue.
