## Paging
Status bits in pages.

### Modify bit
If page is modified, set to 1.

### Reference bit
Shows if page has been used.

These 3 bits will dictate how a page may be used.

## Page replacement algorithms
### FIFO
Allocate pages in frames, free frames.

- If page does not exist in frame, which requires an interrupt, allocate on frame.
- The page is enqueued on stack.
- On next page, if page exists in frame already, no interrupt.
- If page does not exist in frame, and frames are full, next frame is replaced, page is enqueued and first in stack dequeued.

(Look this up).

Program pages
```
-----------------
A
B
C
D
-----------------
```
Suppose the following is the order of page exec:
```
A B A C A B D B A C D
```

When page is not in memory, program will be interrupted and page will be loaded from device to memory.

```
Interrupts 		  *  *  -  *  *  *  *  -  *  *  *
Stack(low, high): A  B  C  A  B  D  D  A  C  D
				     A  A  B  C  A  B  B  D  A  C
```
=> failure rate: 9/11

frames  d c b a d c e d c b a e
```
I
II
III
Inter.
```

Look up FIFO anomaly.

### List recently used (LRU)

consider sequence of pages:
```
a b a c a b d b a c d

Fr.1   a 
Fr.2   
Int.  * 
Stack 
```

Stack will be searched for item least recently used (oldest). Recently used pages get brought to top of stack.

The frame with the oldest page (according to the stack) is then replaced, and the oldest item in stack is removed, followed by a normal stack push of page.

failure rate = interrupts/pages

### FIFO and LRU combined
```
	a b a b f d f c g f g b d e
f1  
f2
f3
```

### reference bit
At start of program, all ref. bits set to zero.

Sometimes ref. *byte* is used.

### More on LRU

```
pg t1 t2 t3 ...

```
