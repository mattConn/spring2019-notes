# Page replacement algorithms

## New method - Segmentation (vs. paging)
- developed by MIT for multix OS
- not as popular as paging
- In *paging*, we do not have control over size of page.
	- division of program into pages is handled by OS, not programmer
- segmentation lets you control how many segments a program has
- segment sizes are not fixed; programmer specifies

### Example
Program
```
--------
line 0			segment 0

Main program

line 349
--------

--------
line 0

sub A			seg. 1

199
--------

--------
line 0

sub B			seg. 2

99
--------
```
These segments can be compiled separately.

Segment map table
```
seg # | size | status | mem. addr.
0		350		In Mem.		4000	
1		200		In Mem.		7000
2		100		Not			-
```
Segments can be shared between programs.

Segments are located same way as pages.

Address will be 2d: seg. num, and address inside seg.

If seg. needs to be stored in memory, we will need to find a space where it will fit... same issues as when mem. was dynamically allocated.

External fragmentation is the issue, but compaction is too expensive.

The *solution* is a combination of segmentation and paging.

*3d address* is then used. This demands a change to hardware, though.
Segment:
```
seg # | displacement | page
```

## Segmented/Demand Paged Mem. Alloc.

SMT
job1
```
seg.| ptr to pmt
0
1
2
```
Table is created on compile time.

job1 | segm0
```
pg# | frame#
0		7
1		4
```
job1 | segm1
```
pg# | frame#
1		7
2		11
```
job1 | segm2
```
pg# | frame#
0		8
1		13
```
segment (3d addressing)
```
job num | seg. num | page num.
```
