## Deadlock avoidance

Avoidance algorithms require additional info about the max number of resources of each type.

### Banker's Algorithm

System is in safe state if it cam allocate resources to each process in some order and still avoid deadlock.

| Job # | allocated | max | remaining needs | available before | available after |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| j1 | 5 | 8 | 3 | :-: | :-: |
| j2 | 3 | 9 | 6 | :-: | :-: |
| j3 | 4 | 8 | 4 | :-: | :-: |
| j4 | 2 | 5 | 3 | :-: | :-: |

The above is in unsafe state; remaining needs should be <= available.

| Job # | allocated | max | remaining needs | available before | available after |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| j1 | 2 | 6 | 4 | 8 | 10 |
| j2 | 4 | 7 | 3 | 10 | 14 |
| j3 | 5 | 6 | 1 | 1 | 6 |
| j4 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 6 | 6 |
| j5 | 2 | 4 | 2 | 6 | 8 |
