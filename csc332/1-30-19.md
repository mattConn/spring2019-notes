We will be using Linux

## Types of operating systems
- Batch - many programs, each executed one at a time
	- no user interaction during execution
	- input relied on punch cards
	- efficiency measure in throughput (no. of jobs)
- Interruptive - user interaction allowed
- real time 
	- reliability is key
	- fast and time-limit sensitive
	- used in military systems, cars, airport traffic control, medical equipment, etc.
	- must be 100% responsive 100% of the time
- hybrid
	- several categories used
	- batch and interactive
		- only one or few programs will be interactive
- embedded
	- on controller, using special hardware/software
- interractive system
	- faster turnaround than batch
		- this is the period of time between arriving and terminating of a job
	- time sharing software developed for OS

## OS brief history
### 1940's: first gen
- computers based on vacuum tube technology
- no std operating system
- typical program included every instruction for computer to complete task
- poor machine uitlization
	- CPU processed data and performed calculations for fraction of available time
- early programs:
	- designed for conservative resource usage
	- understandability not a priority

### 1950's: second gen
- focused on cost effectiveness
- computers were expensive
- 2 widely adopted improvements:
	- computer operators: humans facilitating machine operation
- expensive time lags between CPU and I/O
- tapes, drives, disks, drums
	- Used Drum memory for main memory
	- magnetic, rotated by motor
- Records blocked *before* retrieval or storage
- access methods developed
- added to object code by linkage editor

### 1960's: third gen
- Faster CPU's
- Speed caused problems with slower I/O devices
- multiprogramming (multitasking)
	- allowed loading many programs at a time
- program scheduling
	- initiated with 2nd gen, continues today
- total OS customization

### 1970's
- multiprogramming schemes to increade CPU optimization
- query systems introduced
- started using english-like words, modular structures, and std operations

### 1980's
- cheaper components, more flexible firmware
	- firmware is written for one set of hardware, is always loaded (like a BIOS)
	- multiprocessing
		- allowed parallel execution

### 1990's
- demand for internet capability
- sparked propogation of networking capability
- increased tighter security demands

## Threads
- multiple actions executing simultaneously
- heavyweight process
	- owns resources
	- passive element

## Object-oriented design
- kernel (OS nucleus)
	- os resides in memory at all times, performs essential tasks and protected by hardware
