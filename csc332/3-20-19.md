- Deadlock: two processes waiting for each other to release a resource

## Deadlock prevention
- Prevention, avoidance, detection
- Prevention
	- mutual exclusion
		- increase number of sharable resources
### Hold & wait
	- Any process must submit all requests in advance
	- Before request, and additional resource must release all currently allocated sources.

	- Disadvantages
		- Low resource utilization
		- Starvation: process can wait indefinitely for several popular resources.

### Starvation
- Dining phiolospher's table
	- They can think and they can eat.
	- They need two forks to eat. (Forks are resources).
		- These forks are shared.

### Prevention: No Preemption
- OS in control

### Prevention: Circular wait
- function F : R -> N
- Break circular wait:
	- Any process can request resources only in increasing order

## Deadlock detection
- OS has algorithm for detecting cycles in directed graphs. This algorithm is started periodically after any resource request.

### Recovery
- Abort all deadlocked processes
- restart all processes
- abort one at a time until no longer deadlocked
- successfully preempt resources until deadlock no longer exists
