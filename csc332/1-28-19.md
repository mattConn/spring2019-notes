# csc 332 - 1/28/19

2 exams:
- midterm (with review)
- final

Book: understanding operating systems (mainly)

Lectures will start with historic mechanisms (older machines/OS's)

Presentation is on blackboard.

Manages hardware,software.

Operating system controls who can use computer and how

Historically, includes four essential subsystem managers:
- memory manager
- processor manager
- device manager
- file manager

Networking is fifth subsystem manager

Manager tasks:
- monitor resources continuously
- enforce policies determining:
	- who gets what when and how much
- allocate and deallocate the resource

## main memory management (RAM)
Responisiblities:
- preserve space occupied by OS
	- protection from users
- chekcing legality of space request
- tracks usage of memory by segments
	- data, code, stack segment
- needed in multiuser env
- deallocating memory

## processor management
- allocates cpu
- tracks process status
	- instance of program execution
- Two levels of respnsibility:
	- handle jobs as they enter the sysetm (job scheduler)
		- e.g. handling concurrent threads
	- manage process within jobs (process scheduelr)

Machine instruction to be read by cpu:
```
xxxx|xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ^		   ^
Op. Code    address
```

## Brief history of hardware
Classic example: 1964 IBM 360 model 30
- cpu required 18 sq. ft. air conditioned room
- cpu size: 5 ft. by 6 ft. wide
- internal mem: 64k
- price: $200k (avg. income was 5-7k a year)
