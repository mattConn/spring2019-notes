## Compaction
### Utilizing external fragmentation after dyn. mem. allocation

Jobs in mem. can be shifted up, leaving combined "holes" in mem. in upper address.

If there is a hole that can accomodate a job in mem., this job can be moved alone, and this will save time.

## Better method of compaction (Paging)
### utilizing physical and logical memory.



Job can be segmented into equal sized parts. Phys. mem. will be cut into equal parts as well.

Phys. mem.'s parts are then called *page frames*, with job's parts being *pages*.

- Logical mem. divided into eq. parts is called pages.
- Phys. mem. divided into eq. parts = page frames

### Hardware support for paging
CPU logical address will have page number and page offset.

Phys. address will come from logical; it will then be frame num., and frame offset.

There will be a page table.
