# csc 346

Solve the following:

```
40.5_10 = _2 
```
^ shortcut: find closest base 2 representation first

```
6B1F_16 = 
```
^ 

```
11001
00110 +
-------
11111
```
Solve in BCD:
```
32
14 +
----
46 => 0100 0110

## error checking
Odd parity vs even parity

Example:

```
RAM		CPU
11010 -> 11011   <=== error
```

Odd parity:
- odd number of 1's, including parity bit
- even no. of 1's, inc. parity bit

```
01010 <=== even number of 1's; msb is 0 (parity bit)
```

## ASCII codes
ascii table in binary - row is first 4 bits, column is last 3

## Logic operations
- use logic ops. (+ OR, . AND)

truth table:
```
x  y  X AND Y   X OR Y   NOT X
----------------------------------
0  0    0        0       (invert)
0  1    0        1
1  0    1	 	 1
1  1    1        1
```
`OR` is not exclusive

## logic gates
- AND gate
	- half circle, accepts x and y
- OR gate
	- crescent, accepts x and y
- NOT gate
	- triangle and dot ( |>o ), accepts x

Binary operations are on a closed group, meaing x @ y = something from the set of {x,y}.

*(some set/math things here)*
- X + Y in {S}
- X . Y in {S}

## properties of the binary set
- closure (closed group)
- associativity
- commutative
- distributive
	- x + (yz) -> (x+y)(x+z)
	- x(y+z) -> (xy)+(xz)
- absorption
	- opposite distribution (expansion)

### Identity elements
- 1 for AND
	- 1 . x = x
- 0 for OR
	- 0 + x = x

## Boolean functions
```
f = x . y' + z
```
^ 3 vars, 2^3 combinations of 0's, 1's.

```
x  y  z    x.y'    x.y'+z
--------------------------
0  0  0     0       0
0  0  1     0		1
0  1  0     0		0
0  1  1     0       1
1  0  0     1  		1
1  0  1     1		1
1  1  0     0		0
1  1  1     0		1
```
Having n vars., you will have 2^n combinations.

Chain logic gates to compute

A labled value is a literal, and an operation result is a term.

### note on factoring
For factoring expressions, consider some 0 evalutaing term; this will not alter the expression.
```
expression + xx'  <==== eval. to 0
```

### try this on your own
```
(x+y)(x'+z)(y+z) = 
(xx' + xz + yx' + yz)(y+z) = 
(xz + yx' + yz)(y+z) = 
```
