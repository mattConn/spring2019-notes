## Decoders

A circuit that converts binary information.

- A decoder uses a square diagram with n inputs and 2^n outputs.
- Each output is a minterm

Ex: 2 inputs, 2^2=4 outputs make a 2X4 decoder.

Example 2X4 decoder table:

| xy | d0 | d1 | d2 | d3 |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| 00 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 01 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 10 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 11 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |

For every row, there will be only one 1, and the rest will be zero.

Every function can be represented as a sum of minterms; can also be the same using decorder + OR gates.

```
x --       x'y'
	decoder x'y 
			xy'
y -- 		xy
```

## 7-segment decoder
Segments of a digital number in clock, a through g clockwise.
