## BCD Adder

- If S <= 9, do nothing
- If S > 9, add 6

- Inputs A and B and output S all handle 4 bits.

BCD Cout  = z0z1 + z0z2

^ zn is the BCD digiti.

OR 4 bit adder cout with BCD cout. If 4-bit adder cout is 1, then a 6 needs to be added to the BCD sum

## Multiplier
- AND operators will make a multiplier
$$
A_1A_0 * B_1B_0
$$
$$
	= A_1B_0 A_0B_0 + A_1B_1A_0B_100
$$
$$
= C_{out} P_3  P_2 P_1
$$
