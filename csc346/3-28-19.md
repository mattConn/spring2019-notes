## Encoders
- Inverse operation of decoder
- Output is not unique
- multiple 1's in inputs

## Priority Encoders

## Multiplexers
MUX - used to direct one of the inputs to the outut, depending on the selection lines.

A 2X1 MUX:
```
I_0
    =>  X
I_1
    |
   S_0
```
Where S_n is a selector.

That makes 2^n inputs for 1 output, and n selector lines.

e.g. 4 inputs, 1 output, 2 selector lines.
