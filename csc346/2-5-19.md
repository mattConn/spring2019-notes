## Laws of boolean algebra
- closure: closed between 0 and 1
- associative: (x+y)+z = x+(y+z)
- commutative
- distributive
- identity: 
	- e * x = x
	- e + x = x
	- 1 * x = x
	- 0 + x = x
- complement:
	- x + x' = 1
	- x * x' = 0
- absorption:
	- x + xy = x
	- x(x+y) = x

### truth table
Number of possibile combinations for n vars.: 2$^n$

### Order of operations
1. Parentheses
2. NOT
3. AND
4. OR

## DeMorgan's Law
- (x + y)' = x'y'
	- Complete inversion

- f = xy
	- f' = (xy)' = x' + y'

When inverting expression, go from back
- f = xy' + z
	- f' = (xy' + z)'
	- = (xy')' * z'
	- = (x'+y)z'
	- = x'z' + yz'

### Solving boolean expressions
1. reduce number of terms
2. reduce number of literals
