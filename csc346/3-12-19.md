## HDL (Hardware description language)
Ex: verilog

Given 3 inputs A, B and C
```
A-
  AND - OR - X
B-
		|
C -! ------ Y 
```
$$
x = AB + C'
Y = C'
$$

In verilog, functions are modules.

```
module simple_circuit(A,B,C,X,Y);
input A, B, C;
output X, y;
```

All gates must be labeled to be referred to in verilog:

```
A-
  AND(g1) - OR(g3) - X
B-
		|
C -!(g2) ------ Y 
```

Wires must be labeled as well:

```
A-        e
  AND(g1) - OR(g3) - X
B-
		|
C -!(g2) ------ Y 
```
That is, wire `e`, and 
- `and g1(e,A,B);`
- `not g2(Y,C);`
- `or g3(X,e,y);`


The entire module would look like:
```
module simple_circuit(A,B,C,X,Y);
wire e;
input A,B,C;
output x,y;
and g1(e,A,B);
not g2(Y,C);
or g3(X,e,y);
endmodule;
```
This can be called like:
```
main

simple_circuit(a,b,c,x,y);
```

## Combinational circuit
- Consists of logic gates only.
- Output can be represented by boolean function.
- Output depends on the present value of input.

## sequential circuit
- consists of logic gates and memory elements
- output depends on present value and the state of the memory (past values).
- output can be represented using boolean functions and state equations

## Design procedure of circuits
1. Determine number of inputs/outputs
2. Derive a truth table based on specifications.
3. Obtain simlified function using k-map or bool specification
4. Draw logic diagram
5. Build the circuit

## Example
### Designing a circuit to convert binary to excess-3 code.
Excess-3 code will add 3 to an input.

1. 4-bit binary code will have 4 inputs.
	- numbers beyond 2^4 - 1 will be considered don't care - we will not handle those.

| 01 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 11 | 1 | x | x | x |
| 10 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

$\Rightarrow a + bd + bc$
