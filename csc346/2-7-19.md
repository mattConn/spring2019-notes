### min term
Product term (product as in AND) where all elements are present in either normal or complementary form.

### max term
Sum term (sum as in OR) in which every element is present in either normal or complemented form.

Truth tables with min/max terms:
```
x y z | minterm | maxterm
-------------------------
000    x'y'z'
001    x'y'z
010    x'yz'
011
100
101
110
111
```
### Sum of Minterms/Product of maxterms
A boolean function that can be expressed from truth table by ORing minterms that produce a 1 in functions.

It can also be expresssed by ANDing maxterms that produce a 0 in functions.

e.g.
```
xyz | f$_1$
-----------
000   0
001   0
010   1 -> m$_2$
011   0
111   1 -> m$_4$
```
$$
\sum m_n
$$

### std. form vs canonical form
Simplified vs expanded
