## N-bit adders
- Constructed with full adders.
- The cout from each adder is connected to the cin ofthe next full adder.
	- This is how carries are handled.

## Adder subtractor
B' = B xor 1

This can add and subtract.

The first carry in uses function M=mode; M is sent to each adder's B input and Xor'd with B.
