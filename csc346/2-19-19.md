Express as product of maxterms
```
f = x'y + xz

= x'y(z + z') + xz(y+y')  <--- y+y' = 1

= x'yz + x'yz' + xyz + xy'z <--- treating n' = 0
	=> 3,2,7,5

	=> sum(2,3,7,5)
```

Express as sum of minterms
```
f(a,b,c,d) = a+b'c + ad

= a(b+b')(c+c')(d+d')+b'c(a+a')(d+d')+ad(b+b')(c+c')
```

## forms
- canonical form
	- sum of minterms
	- product of maxterms

- std. form
	- sum of products
	- product of sums

- non-std. form

## New logical fn's

### XOR (exclusive OR)
- notation: (+)
	- x (+) y = xy' + x'y
In a table, an odd number of 1's will give a 1.

```
x y z x%y%z
0 0 0   0
0 0 1   1
0 1 0   1
0 1 1   0
...
```
### XNOR (inverse XOR)
- notation: XOR with high bar
```
_______
x (+) Y
```

### NAND and NOR
- inverse and and or
- more efficient that AND, OR

### gates
- XOR
```
=) ))
```
where `))` is OR.

NAND and NOR are more efficient.

## gate times
- AND takes 1 nano sec.
- OR takes 2 nano sec.

## Karnaugh map (gate level minimization)
2 var. map
```
   0    1
-----------
0|    |    |

1|    |    |

```
X = col, y = row

A map consisting of squares with each square representing one minterm.
