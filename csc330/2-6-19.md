## no inheritance from base of:
- friends
- constructors
- destructors
- assignment ops.

Base class constuctor is not inherited but can be invoked.

## inheritance
Base class has only def. constructor without params.

Derived class default constructor will invoke base class default constuctor.

### passing arguments to base constructor
`derived( ... ) : base(...) {}`
(Like an initializer list).
