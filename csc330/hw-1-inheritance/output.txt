**** Testing point2d methods ****

Calling x and y getters:
x = 2, y = 3

Testing for equality between p1 and p2:
p1 == p2: 0

Calling point2d print:
(x, y) = (2, 3)

**** Testing circle methods ****

Calling radius getter:
radius = 4.00

Testing for equality between c1 and c2:
c1 == c2: 0

Testing area getting function:
area = 50.27

testing distance from origin function:
distance from (0, 0)  = 3.61

Testing distance from other circle function:
distance from c2 (5, 6)  = 4.24

Testing non-member Circle distance functions:
	testing non-member distance from origin function:
	distance from (0, 0)  = 3.61

	testing non-member distance from other circle function:
	distance from c1 (2, 3) to c2 (5, 6)  = 4.24

Calling circle print:
(x, y) = (2, 3)
radius = 4.00

**** Testing cylinder methods ****

Calling height getter:
height = 5.00

Calling area getter:
area = 226.19

Calling volume getter:
volume = 251.33

Testing for equality between 2 cylinders:
cy1 == cy2: 0

Testing cylinder print:
(x, y) = (2, 3)
radius = 4.00
height = 5.00
