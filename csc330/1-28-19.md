# csc 330 - 1/28/19

Types of programming:
- unstructed programming
	- small, main program, global variables
- procedural programming
	- combined sequence of calling statements
	- procedure calls
	- main program passes data to procedures, procedures pass back to main
- modular programming
	- smaller modules working with main (which is also a module)

- structural programming
	- statement sequences (s1,s2,...sn)
	- branching (if/else)
	- looping
	- *Pascal* was first sructural lang

## abstraction
"is-a" and "has-a" abstraction

- Division into parts (has-a abstraction)
- Division into specialization (Is-a abstraction)

Abstract data types
- info. hiding
- exports a type
- exports a set of ops. (an interface)
	- interface is only point of access

## OOP
- Object is derived from abstract type
- data encapsulation
- Objects send messages to each other

# Lab 1
1. no cin, cout in any function defs. of the class, except `print` (or `display`.
2. use minimal number of parameters for methods
3. Two combinations of constructors
	- default (no params)
	- general (up to 5 params)
		- OR
	- only one default constructor with all params defaulted
4. All getters have non-void return type respective to data member
5. All setters have return type void
6. Print function returns void
7. In general, print displays private data

No friend functions!

No op. overloading!

## addition of complex numbers
```
z = z1 + z2 =
(x1 + iy1) + (x2 + iy2) =
   ^			^
Re Z			Im Z

```


## multiplication  of complex numbers
```
z = z1 * z2 =
(x1 + iy1) * (x2 + iy2) =
(x1*x2 - y1*y2) + i(x1*y2 + x2*y1)
```
