## OOP main benefit
Code reuse

When to use inheritance?
- you have a class c, and you want a class D that does what C does and more

### Is-a and has-a relationship
e.g. car *is a* kind of transportation

### editing access for classes
`using base::method;` in a subclass of `base` will move `method` wherever this instruction is written (i.e. from public section to private).

### name hiding
There is no function overloading between classes, but name hiding.

scope resolution op. can simulate overloading, however.
